A little program that pings you when a new player get online with DreamPi.

I made this program in a couple hours in Processing. It is essentially a little program that fetches the data out of Kazada's Dreamcast-Now platform and displays it in a minimal but efficient fashion.

It currently does not run in the background and I'm not sure what the easiest solution would be fore this. Once this is completed, I'll provide cute packages and everything.
