# DCnow_widget
A little program that pings you when a new player get online with their Dreamcast Console
I made this program in a couple hours in Processing. It is neither the best solution and I would hardly call this a widget. The idea was to have something that refresh quite requently (60 seconds? I mean 5 mins would probabbly be enough) and that you could run in the background

It currently does not run in the background and I'm not sure what the easiest solution would be fore this.

Once this is completed, I'll provide cute packages and everything.
